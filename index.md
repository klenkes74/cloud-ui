# Welcome to CloudUi

## Idea

I like the idea of programming the frontend in java, like you can do with [vaadin flow](https://vaadin.com). Unfortunaly vaadin apps are not stateless. So they did not scale very well. Deep inside there is gwt also in flow. Building has become in my point of you a pain with all the npm processing.

How would look like a portal if it was invented nowadays? 

This is a first POC of my Ideas: 

Build a cloud native ui framework for [quarkus](https://quarkus.io) but not limited to. Influenced by webcomponents and the idea of ui mircoservices.
It should be stateless and easy to integrate with quarkus, also build on vanilla browser technologies without GWT or Javascript frameworks.
